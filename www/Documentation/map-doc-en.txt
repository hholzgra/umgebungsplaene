Setting the central point
-------------------------

The first thing to do is to set the central point for which you want to
create a neighbourhood plan. You will see a blue form in the side bar titled
"Standort" and a croshair marker on the slippy map.

You can move the crosshair marker to the desired spot in three different
ways:

* by dragging the markrer to the desired position with the mouse

* by moving the map while the marker stays in the center of the map area
  until the desired spot is below the marker

* by doing a search and selecting one of the found objects, the marker
  will then be set to the position of the selected object

When you have found the desired position you can close the form with
the ðŸ—¹ button. The position of the marker is now fixed. To change its
position again you can click on the crosshair marker to re-open the
form.

On the printed map the central point position will be marked with a
red "you are here" circle.

The map title
-------------

The map title can be set via the "Name:" field of the central point form .

On the printed map the given title will be shown in the blue title bar,
right next to the "Refugees welcome" logo:

Creating a marker category
--------------------------

The map markers are organized into categories, each having its own
category title and marker color scheme. With the [+] button in the
upper right corner you can create new categories.

Each category gets its own title, a distinct color used for the
markers and the category title bar, and an icon to be shown in
the title bar next to the title.

The color picker may look differently depending on which web browser
is used, here you see what it looks like in Google Chrome:

The category icon can be selected from a list of predefined symbols.


Placing a marker
----------------

After having created at least one category it is now possible to
place actual markers for points of interest. For this you need to
click on the category title with the right mouse button, or long-press
the category title when using a touch screen. This will open a context
menu in which you see a menu item "Add POI"

image:images/map-edit-7.png[]

For each marker a name and a symbol icon can be set to be shown in
the sidebar of the printed map.

Initially a new marker is shown in the middle of the map, like with the
center marker at the beginning you can either drag the marker to the
desired position, or move the slippy map below it until the tip of
the marker is over the desired position.

After having placed at least one marker a blue rectangle outline will
appear on the map. This is showing the area guaranteed to be visible
on the printed map, so that all markers can be seen. As the actual
map area on the printed map is more or less square the actually printed
area will be extended either vertically or horizontally, depending on
whether the marked area is rather wide or tall.


Automatic POI marker placement
------------------------------

image:images/map-edit-9.png[]

The "wizzard stick" icon in the icon bar on the left some typical marker
categories are auto-generated and filled with markers for some typical
types of POIs located in the currently visible map area.

For now these are:

* hospitals
* pharmacies
* supermarkets
* churches (only protestant and catholic) and mosques

The suitable marker entries for the visible map area are determined via
a live query using the Overpass API, so depending on the visible area this
may take a few seconds.

After invoking the wizzard the result may e.g. look like this:

Editing markers
---------------

You may, especially after using the wizzard to auto-generate markers, want
to be able to remove an already created marker. This can be done in two
ways.

image:images/map-edit-11.png[]

Each entry in the tree has its own context menu which opens when doing a
right-click on the entry, or when doing a long press on it on a touch screen.
The options in the context menu allow to delete a single marker, or to
remove a complete category including all of its markers.

By simply clicking on a marker, or tapping on it in a touch screen, the
edit menu for the marker opens in the side bar. Here you can not only
change title, symbol and position of the marker, you can also use the
"Trashcan" button to remove the marker completely.

It is also possible to move markers to a different category by using
drag&drop to move the entry to a different position within the category/marker
tree.

Show all markers
----------------

With the "picture frame" icon in the icon bar the map position and zoom
will be changed so that all current markers are visible. For this the
map may be panned and the zoom factor may change.


Saving and loading
------------------

These two functions are only in a rudiemtary state for now.

With the "Floppy disk" symbol the current map state will be
downloaded as a file using the map title as base name and
the file extension ".map" into the default
download directory of your browser. Changing the file name
or the directory is not possible. Saving only works locally
on the current client device, there is no server side storage
functionality yet.

Using the "open folder" icon you can load a previously saved
".map" file to continue editing.


Create the printable map
------------------------

image:images/map-edit-pdf.png[]

When having placed all desired POI markers you can use the "Printer"
Icon to create the actual printable map file. This will be created
as a PDF using the DIN-A1 poster size paper format (ca. 80x60cm or 36x24")
and will be downloaded automatically.

In the future it may also be possible to choose a different file format,
like SVG or PNG.
