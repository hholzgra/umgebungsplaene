# Neighbourhood Maps (German: "Umgebungspl√§ne") 

An alternative web frontend for the [MapOSMatic](https://github.com/hholzgra/maposmatic) 
map rendering service, focusing on the creation of simple neighbourhood points of 
interest plans.

Points of interest can be added to a map interactively, and once done a printable PDF
poster with a map with markers, and a POI index sidebar, can be generated by a single
click.

Detailed usage documentation is available in the www/Documentation folder, or online
in [German](https://nearby.get-map.org/Documentation/map-doc.html)
and [English](https://nearby.get-map.org/Documentation/map-doc-en.html)
